# Overview

Here is a **GitHub Actions workflow** for running Postman collections as part of a CI/CD pipeline, which I created as part of 
a [Test Automation](https://www.postman.com/valentins-team/test-automation-valentino-s-artisan-coffee-house-api/overview) course.
Through this course, I aimed to broaden my knowledge of Postman features to enhance my testing approach and sharpen my skills in API testing â€” an area I am passionate about.

<br>

The most valuable and interesting aspects of the course for me included:

* **Integrating Postman tests into CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
* **Using JSON Schema validation awith regular expressions to enforce data formats**
* **Debugging tests with Postman Mock Servers**

<br>

It was a great opportunity to expand my skills and bring more structure and efficiency to my API testing practice.
